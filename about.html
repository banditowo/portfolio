        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I am a 24 year old woman from Stockholm, Sweden. I studied music from 2014 up until 2020 and have been making<br>
                music for fun ever since. I also started learning programming and studied at FutureGames from 2022 until 2025.<br>
                <br>    
                My love and appreciation for music and games lead me to pursue a career in these fields. I like to understand the<br>
                things I enjoy, and to get a look at the behind the scenes to immerse myself in the arts and express my creativity!<br>
                <br>
                As a person, I like to think of myself as an open-minded, easy going and creative person. I like to form close<br>
                connections with friends and co-workers, so that we can communicate and work better together as a team!<br>
                <br>
                I really want to further increase my knowledge in both game development and music production, find fun ways to<br>
                incorporate both of them, and try to be as best as I can be in both these fields (:
